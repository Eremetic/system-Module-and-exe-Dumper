includes kernel module dumper via kernel driver, 
Process Dumper via kernel driver, 


It has also been a training ground for learning, I've included unhooking all dlls, system token hijack via kernel driver, adding hardware breakpoint to suspended process via thread context.

done via console app just for feel. Though i know winform or wpf would be much more user friendly.

Currently just using a GDRVLoader exploit to load the driver, thank you "Zer0Condition" it has been reliable.

Thank you  Lazaro, C5pider, mrd0x, NULL, and idov31 cant thank them enough for their help learning and working through problems on this project so far.

TODO list:

!!!almost done  standard dumper

!Fix Leaked Driver Device
